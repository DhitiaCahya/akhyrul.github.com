    <p><a href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a> has really hooked me over the last year and I even have decided to never look back to <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter (CI)</a> anymore since then. But unfortunately, I recently got a web development job that still using ancient PHP version Laravel doesn't (and never been) support :(</p>

<p>Definitely, using Laravel (and peeking at its core source code) has taught me many advanced PHP things and how web development should better be. Laravel's clean and expressive syntax is a real breeze and made me realized (and a lil bit disgusted) how ugly CodeIgniter style was when I have to work with it again after a long time.</p>

<p>This time I will show you <a href="http://www.toddandrae.com/?p=95">a trick I found</a> and modified a little to conform Laravel's style I've been used to enjoy. Let's get started ;)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Consider the following CodeIgniter styled controller actions:</p>

<pre><code>class Article extends CI_Controller {

    public function add()
    {
        if($this-&gt;input-&gt;post('submit'))
        {
            // Process the form inputs
            // then redirect to success page
        }
        else
        {
            // Show the form
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Laravel's controller has a feature that called RESTful controllers/actions that separates route mapping to different methods based on the HTTP request (post, get, put, delete, etc) made. Take a look at this one:</p>

<pre><code>class Article extends Controller {

    public $resful = true;

    public function get_add()
    {
        // Show the form
    }

    public function post_add()
    {
        // Process the form inputs
        // then redirect to success page
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Elegant, isn't it? That way we can keep the URL for forms and processing the same yet preventing multiple form submission while keeping the code clean. Â The route 'article/add' (assuming we're using standard route-action mapping) mapping will splitted to to different methods based on the HTTP request made by user. It will route to get_add() if the request is GET, and get_post() if it's a POST one. Pretty clear, huh?</p>

<h4>Here's the trick</h4>

<p>We can get the same effect in CodeIgniter by using custom router class <a href="http://www.toddandrae.com/?p=95">as pointed by Todd in his article</a>. I just modified the code a little to mimic Laravel more. So we started by a custom class, create a file in 'application/core' named 'MY_Router.php'</p>

<pre><code>class MY_Router extends CI_Router {
    function fetch_method()
    {
        $request = strtolower($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']);

        if ($this-&gt;method == $this-&gt;fetch_class()) 
        {
            $method = $request.'_index';
        } 
        else 
        {
            $method = $request.'_'.$this-&gt;method;
        }

        return $method;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's all! Now you get the same functionality as Laravel's RESTful Controller in CodeIgniter.</p>
