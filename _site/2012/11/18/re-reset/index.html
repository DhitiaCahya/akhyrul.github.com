    <p>Guess how many times have I been reset my blog? :p</p>

<p>It's been a long time since the last time I even visited this blog. Now I get back to it and find out that my blog has been flooded by SPAM!</p>

<p>Damn, no wonder my hosting provider keeps bugging me with annoying reminder emails saying that my account's disk usage has been exceeded the limit. The blog's database alone has a size of 23 Megabytes with no limit but using my account's global disk quota instead. Added with old posts' Â image files, it has been consuming 100% of my quota, and I have no intention on upgrading my hosting plan (yeah, it's cheap and operated by reputable hoster but sucks <a href="http://akhyar.web.id/2012/11/web-hosting-service-knows-my-password/">in some area</a>).</p>

<p>It's better for me to re-reset it rather than dealing with those massive spams. Anyone can advise me how to make my WordPress blog more spam-proof without sacrificing visitors' convenience?</p>
